		</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<p>This is an official repository of information for the Hall of Eira Spire in the nation of Wintermark in
				Empire Larp. It also contains information on Skills, Potions, and Spells used in the game.</p>
			<br>
			<p>If none of that makes sense, this app isn't for you.</p>

			<p>You may need to activate downloading in the settings page.</p>
			<br>
			<p>It may take a few moments for the data to load and you may have to restart the app.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Check your internet connection. Once the data is downloaded you won't need a connection to access the
				data in future except to receive updates.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The content is hosted remotely and the free version of the service hosting the data has a limited number of
				reads per day. If nothing is loading, the maximum number of reads has been reached so you will have to
				try again tomorrow. Once it's been downloaded, it won't have to be re-downloaded.</p>

			<ion-card-title>Why do I need to answer a question to activate downloads?</ion-card-title>
		</ion-card-header>
		<ion-card-content>
			<p>Three reasons:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>This app is freely available on the app store which means that it can be downloaded by anyone.</li>
				<li>The remote storage service limits the amount that can be downloaded in a day. I don't want it to be potentially capped out by random people.</li>
				<li>Increasing this limit is pay-as-you-go which means the cost scales with data downloaded, which makes increasing it non-viable.</li>
